	1. Need to make sure the bin folder recursively has execute permissions for the web server
	2. Required libraries to install from source:
		-   gcc
		-   SSE? (maybe)
		-   libpng-dev
			ldconfig -p | grep "libpng" (12.so? otherNumber.so?)
		-   zlib
			ldconfig -p | grep "libz" (.so?)
	3. Only need to call "make" -- this compiles the script... "make install" copies it to a global directory
	4. Future enhancement: Instead of just failing if the required libraries are missing, just
		include all libraries we need in the /src directory so we don't need to use shared libraries
